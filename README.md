# Resume & Job Posting Analysis using NLP, Regex, and Fuzzy Matching
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing job postings and resumes using web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and fuzzy matching techniques. It extracts and compares skills, experience, education, certifications, keywords, and salary expectations between job descriptions and candidate resumes. The results are visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard to evaluate ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility.
## Key Features
- **Automated Job Scraping** using Selenium for dynamic job portal data
- **Resume Parsing** and information extraction using NLP & regex
- **Skill, Education, Experience, and Certification Matching**
- **Fuzzy Matching Algorithm** to align resume qualifications with job requirements
- **ATS Score Computation** to quantify resume-job compatibility
- **Power BI Dashboard** for visual insights and analysis

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Regex, spaCy, FuzzyWuzzy)
- **Power BI** (Interactive dashboards for data visualization)
- **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib** (for data analysis and cleaning)
